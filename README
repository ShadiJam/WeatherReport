Weather Report works with API's from Google Maps Geolocation (GMG) and Dark Sky Weather (DSW).

When run, the console will prompt the user to input their zipcode. Once they press enter 
the zipcode is sent to GMG and the latitude and longitude of that zip code is returned and sent to DSW. 

DSW then returns the weather report for that location and prints it to the console.
